Create a quick Ruby DSL application that allows a user to draw polygons on a map. Users should be able to save polygon coordinates from the map to MongoDB backend database as GeoJSON format and the user should also be provided with a "View coordinates" button using which he should be able to see the saved coordinates.

**This application should have:**


 1. A service that saves the coordinates to MongoDB 
 2. An API service that will provide the saved coordinates from the above (MongoDB) to a client service 
 3. A client service that calls the mentioned API service so that it can provide the coordinates to the user to be able to see
    it printed on the browser (front-end).

Write tests for each component of your application using RSpec.

It is mandatory that this application NOT be written using the rails framework.
